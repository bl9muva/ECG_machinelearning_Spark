# ECG_machinelearning_Spark
This is a group project that I did with my other three group members. I hided their names in this Github space, 
but I have to point out that if anyone wants to reuse any code in this repository, credits should be given to
all of my groupmates. 

* Machine learning ECG dataset to determine the disease state of hearts
* pyspark and python
